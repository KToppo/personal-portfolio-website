        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p class="about-intro">
            My journey so far has been shaped by curiosity, discipline, and a very clear desire
            to build something meaningful—for my family and for myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            I completed my <span class="grayscale-bold">B.Com (Honours) in 2024</span>, but my interest never stayed
            confined to textbooks or traditional career paths. During my studies, a case study
            on <span class="grayscale-bold">Manyavar</span> introduced me to how simple data science tools were used
            to scale a legacy business. That insight changed the way I looked at data. I realized
            that behind strong decisions and sustainable growth, there is often a layer of
            <span class="grayscale-bold">machine learning</span> quietly doing the heavy lifting.
        </p>

        <p>
            Coming from a commerce background, stepping into machine learning wasn’t comfortable—or
            obvious. But I’ve never been afraid of learning from scratch. After graduation, I
            deliberately built my foundation in <span class="grayscale-bold">mathematics, statistics,
            and algorithms</span>, and in <span class="grayscale-bold">2025</span>, I formally pursued a
            <span class="grayscale-bold">Diploma in Data Science at IT-Vedant</span> to give structure
            to my transition.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, I consider myself a <span class="grayscale-bold">machine learning enthusiast
            at an early-career stage</span>, actively learning by building. I enjoy working across
            the full data lifecycle—cleaning messy data, exploring patterns, engineering features,
            training models, and evaluating them in ways that actually make sense for real-world use.
            I’ve worked on datasets across <span class="grayscale-bold">food-tech, healthcare,
            and finance</span>, and built practical projects like
            <span class="grayscale-bold">recommendation systems, classifiers, and emotion detection models</span>
            using Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and ML frameworks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Interestingly, <span class="grayscale-bold">Python</span> has been part of my life much
            longer than my formal ML journey. I started using it back in <span class="grayscale-bold">2018</span>,
            initially as a creative tool—building apps with Kivy/KivyMD, creating Telegram bots,
            automating daily tasks, and experimenting with web scraping. That early experimentation
            shaped how I approach machine learning today: practical first, theory where it matters,
            and always focused on solving real problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of tech, I value self-discipline and self-expression just as much. I train in
            <span class="grayscale-bold">calisthenics</span>, learning through experimentation and
            consistency rather than shortcuts. I also enjoy sketching, and I run a sketching page
            called <span class="grayscale-bold">“sptrop”</span>, where drawing helps me slow down,
            observe, and think visually—skills that surprisingly carry over into how I approach
            data and models.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the core of everything I do is a clear personal goal: to build a life that allows
            me to give my family comfort, security, and freedom, while also pursuing my own passions.
            One of those dreams is owning an <span class="grayscale-bold">ADV motorcycle</span>—not
            just to ride, but to truly understand. I want to be capable enough to repair, maintain,
            and trust my machine, travel across India first, and then explore other countries.
        </p>

        <p>
            For me, that mindset—understanding systems deeply instead of just using them—applies
            equally to bikes, bodies, art, and machine learning.
        </p>

        <p class="about-closing">
            Right now, I’m focused on growing as a machine learning practitioner—learning
            continuously, building consistently, and aiming for roles where ML is applied
            thoughtfully, not blindly. I’m not chasing shortcuts. I’m building capability,
            one layer at a time.
        </p>
