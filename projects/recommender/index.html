        <h1>Recommendation Systems</h1>

        <p class="about-intro">
            Learning through progressive design — understanding recommendations step by step,
            not by jumping straight to complexity.
        </p>

        <p>
            My journey into recommendation systems started with a simple question:
            <em>How do platforms suggest relevant content when they know very little about the user?</em>
            Instead of jumping straight into complex models, I approached this domain step by step,
            building two projects that intentionally cover different recommendation strategies.
        </p>

        <h2>Phase 1: Content-Based Movie Recommendation System</h2>

        <p>
            My first project focused on <span class="grayscale-bold">content-based filtering</span>,
            where recommendations are generated purely from item attributes rather than user behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
            I built a movie recommender that suggests similar movies based on metadata such as
            <span class="grayscale-bold">genres, keywords, cast, and plot descriptions</span>.
            The goal was to understand how feature representation and similarity measures drive
            recommendations without relying on user history.
        </p>

        <p class="grayscale-bold">Key learning outcomes from this phase:</p>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Transforming raw textual metadata into numerical vectors</li>
            <li>Why cosine similarity works well for high-dimensional text features</li>
            <li>The importance of precomputing similarity matrices for real-time performance</li>
            <li>Clear separation between offline training and online inference</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To make the system interactive, I deployed it as a
            <span class="grayscale-bold">Streamlit web application</span> and integrated the
            <span class="grayscale-bold">TMDB API</span> to fetch movie posters dynamically.
            This phase highlighted the strengths and limitations of content-based systems —
            particularly their inability to adapt to evolving user preferences.

        <h2>Phase 2: Book Recommendation System — Expanding Beyond Content</h2>

        <p>
            After completing the movie recommender, I realized an important gap:
            <span class="grayscale-bold">not all recommendation systems rely on content alone</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To address this, I built a Book Recommendation System that deliberately introduced
            two new paradigms:
        </p>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li><span class="grayscale-bold">Popularity-Based Recommendation</span></li>
            <li><span class="grayscale-bold">Collaborative Filtering</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The popularity-based module ranks books using engagement thresholds and average ratings,
            mirroring real-world “Trending” or “Top Picks” systems where social proof matters.
        </p>

        <p>
            The collaborative filtering module:
        </p>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Builds a user–book interaction matrix</li>
            <li>Measures similarity between books using shared user ratings</li>
            <li>Recommends books liked by users with similar preferences</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This project helped me understand the trade-offs between
            <span class="grayscale-bold">popularity, personalization, and cold-start problems</span>,
            and how the same similarity logic behaves differently when driven by users instead of content.
        </p>

        <h2>What These Projects Represent Together</h2>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>A structured understanding of multiple recommendation paradigms</li>
            <li>Awareness of when each approach is appropriate</li>
            <li>Practical system design over metric chasing</li>
            <li>Progression from item-based logic to user-driven personalization</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These projects were built while learning, guided by educational resources,
            but every implementation choice was made to understand the
            <span class="grayscale-bold">“why” behind recommendation systems</span>, not just the “how”.
        </p>

        <p class="about-closing">
            These are not production-scale recommenders — and that’s intentional.
            Their value lies in concept coverage and progression, not novelty.
            Presented honestly, they strengthen a profile. Oversold, they weaken it.
