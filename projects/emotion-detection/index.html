        <h1>Emotion Detection Without Deep Learning</h1>

        <p class="about-intro">
            <strong>A deliberate constraint project.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Most emotion detection systems today rely on deep learning by default.
            <span class="grayscale-bold">I deliberately chose not to.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            This project started as a final assessment during my Data Science program at
            <span class="grayscale-bold">IT-Vedant</span>, but very quickly turned into a personal challenge:
            <em>Can a facial emotion detection system be built using only classical machine learning —
            and still work in real-world conditions?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead of taking the obvious CNN route, I restricted myself to traditional ML models
            to deeply understand <span class="grayscale-bold">feature extraction, data imbalance,
            model behavior, and ensemble decision-making</span>.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2>The Core Problem (and Why It Was Non-Trivial)</h2>


        <div class="project-image">
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/projects/emotion_detection.png') }}"
                alt="Emotion Detection System Output">
            <p class="image-caption">
                Real-time facial emotion detection using classical machine learning
                and ensemble decision-making.

        </div>




        <p>
            Emotion datasets are inherently imbalanced. Some emotions dominate, others barely exist.
            Training a classifier naively gives high overall accuracy but completely fails minority
            emotions — which defeats the entire purpose.
        </p>

        <p>I experimented with:</p>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>
                <span class="grayscale-bold">SMOTE</span> — Balanced class distribution,
                but weak real-world performance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="grayscale-bold">SMOTEENN</span> — Better overall scores,
                but unstable class-wise predictions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Neither approach alone was acceptable.
            That’s when I stopped chasing a single “best model” and shifted to
            <span class="grayscale-bold">model behavior analysis</span>.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2>My Solution: Stacking Based on Failure Patterns</h2>

        <p>
            Instead of forcing one algorithm to do everything, I trained
            <span class="grayscale-bold">five different classical ML models</span>
            using:
        </p>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Different resampling strategies</li>
            <li>Balanced vs weighted <code>class_weight</code> configurations</li>
            <li>Models with distinct strengths across emotion classes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Each model failed differently — <span class="grayscale-bold">and that was the insight</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I stacked these models using:
        </p>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Majority voting</li>
            <li>Probability aggregation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This ensemble approach significantly improved robustness across emotions,
            even when individual models struggled.
            <strong>This was not accidental performance — it was engineered diversity.</strong>
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2>Real-World Accuracy: Closing the Face Detection Gap</h2>

        <p>
            Another major issue surfaced during testing.
            The training dataset contained already cropped faces — real images do not.
        </p>

        <p>To close this gap:</p>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>
                Used the same <span class="grayscale-bold">Haar Cascade face detection</span>
                model used by the dataset creator
            </li>
            <li>Implemented face detection and cropping during inference</li>
            <li>Ensured consistency between training and prediction pipelines</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This significantly improved real-world usability.
            That said, I documented limitations intentionally:
        </p>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Extremely close or poorly framed faces can fail detection</li>
            <li>Some misclassification occurs due to bounding box distortion</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Hiding these would have been dishonest.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2>What This Project Actually Demonstrates</h2>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Practical handling of imbalanced classification problems</li>
            <li>When and why resampling techniques fail</li>
            <li>How ensemble learning compensates for individual model weaknesses</li>
            <li>The importance of data pipeline consistency</li>
            <li>Trade-offs between accuracy, interpretability, and robustness</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Most importantly, it demonstrates
            <span class="grayscale-bold">decision-making under constraints</span>,
            not blind algorithm usage.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I’m Proud of This Project</h2>

        <p>
            Not because it’s perfect — it isn’t.
            But because every design choice was <span class="grayscale-bold">intentional,
            tested, and justified</span>.
        </p>

        <p class="about-closing">
            I don’t blindly follow trends.  
            I analyze failure before optimizing success.  
            I care about real-world behavior, not just leaderboard scores.
