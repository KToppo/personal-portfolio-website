        <h1>PCOD & PCOS Health Data Analysis</h1>

        <p class="about-intro">
            Exploring patterns responsibly — without crossing into diagnosis or medical claims.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project was created to explore how data analysis can be used to understand
            <span class="grayscale-bold">complex health conditions</span> without crossing into
            unsafe or misleading conclusions.
        </p>

        <p>
            PCOD and PCOS are widely discussed but often poorly understood, especially when
            conversations rely on anecdotes instead of data. My goal was not to
            <strong>“predict disease”</strong>, but to analyze patterns, correlations, and
            lifestyle indicators present in real-world health data.
        </p>

        <p>
            I approached this project with one clear boundary:
            <span class="grayscale-bold">analysis for awareness and insight, not medical judgment</span>.
        </p>

        <h2>How I Approached the Problem</h2>

        <p>
            The dataset contained multiple <span class="grayscale-bold">physiological and
            lifestyle-related attributes</span> associated with women’s health.
            Instead of treating it as a classification task, I focused on
            <span class="grayscale-bold">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</span> to answer
            practical, responsible questions such as:
        </p>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>How do health indicators vary between affected and non-affected groups?</li>
            <li>Are certain patterns consistently associated with PCOD/PCOS?</li>
            <li>Which features show stronger relationships, and which are mostly noise?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I began with careful <span class="grayscale-bold">data cleaning and validation</span>,
            handling missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers — an especially important step
            for health-related data where errors can mislead interpretation.
        </p>

        <p>
            From there, I used visualizations and statistical summaries to explore:
        </p>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Hormonal and metabolic indicators</li>
            <li>Body metrics and lifestyle variables</li>
            <li>Distribution differences across groups</li>
            <li>Correlations that may warrant deeper clinical investigation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            At every step, the focus remained on
            <span class="grayscale-bold">interpreting trends responsibly</span>,
            not forcing conclusions.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2>Key Insights and Observations</h2>

        <p>
            The analysis revealed that:
        </p>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Certain health indicators show noticeable distribution differences between groups</li>
            <li>Some commonly assumed factors have weaker relationships than expected</li>
            <li>A small subset of features consistently stands out across multiple views of the data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            More importantly, the project highlighted how easily
            <span class="grayscale-bold">misleading conclusions</span> can emerge if analysis is
            not done carefully — reinforcing why EDA is critical before any modeling or inference.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2>What This Project Actually Demonstrates</h2>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Responsible handling of sensitive health data</li>
            <li>Strong EDA skills applied to a real-world, high-impact domain</li>
            <li>The ability to translate numerical patterns into human-understandable insights</li>
            <li>Awareness of ethical boundaries in data science</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            It reflects a mindset that prioritizes
            <span class="grayscale-bold">interpretation, caution, and clarity</span>
            over flashy claims.
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Project Matters in My Portfolio</h2>

        <p>
            Unlike recommendation systems or classifiers, this project required:
        </p>

        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Slower, more deliberate analysis</li>
            <li>Ethical awareness</li>
            <li>Clear communication without overclaiming</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            It strengthened my ability to work with real-world data where mistakes matter,
            and where <span class="grayscale-bold">insight is more valuable than prediction</span>.
        </p>

        <p class="about-closing">
            Health data is powerful — and dangerous if misused.
            This project respects that reality.
            It focuses on understanding patterns, raising the right questions,
            and demonstrating analytical discipline — not pretending to replace medical expertise.
